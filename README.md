# 2020-Election-COVID-Effect
The aim of this project is to display COVID-19 cases, deaths or recoveries against the 2020 US election results.  The data for the COVID-19 cases and deaths will be sourced from the John Hopkins' COVID-19 GitHub page while the 2020 US election results will be cited from Politico's reporting of the election results.
